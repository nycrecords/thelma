## Introduction
This repository contains the terraform scripts to build out the NYC Municipal Archives THELMA Digital Platform using AWS / Azure.

## What is THELMA?
THELMA is the digital content management system for the NYC Municipal Archives and Library. Using open-source components, it is a full pipeline of tools to assist in the long-term preservation and storage of the assets of the Municipal Library and Archives. Additionally, it provides a public access interface to allow researchers to access our digitized holdings from anywhere in the world. 

## Components
### ArchivesSpace
> [ArchivesSpace](http://archivesspace.org/) is the next-generation web-based archives information management system, designed by archivists and supported by diverse archival repositories.

The NYC Municipal Archives uses ArchivesSpace to maintain its up-to-date collection inventories for its holdings.
